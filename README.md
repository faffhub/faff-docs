# faffage
Faffage is a local-first standard ledger that helps you think about how you're choosing to spend your time. It serves you first - time is tracked on your device, and you choose what, when, and how to share that record with whomever you choose.

Faffage is a standard and open format for tracking time. It is built to be extensible and play nicely with other time tracking services, on your terms.

## Philosophy of Time Tracking
Most time tracking services think first about _billing_ and second about _efficiency_. If they think about you at all, it's as a distant third. Faffage trains you to use your time _intentionally_. An entry in your ledger could be as simple as a title, but Faffage encourages you for any given block of time to consider:

- **Role** - what role are you performing? e.g. Software Developer; Support Engineer; Mother; Friend; Human
- **Action** - what action are you performing? e.g. Attending a Meeting; Preparing a Presentation; Fixing a Bug; Driving a Car
- **Objective** - what are you trying to achieve? e.g. New Revenue from a New Customer; Improve Product Quality; Heal
- **Subject** - who or what is this for? e.g. Bob; Acme Corporation; Yourself

## Reflection
Faffage encourages _reflection_. Look back on your day and capture how you felt about each activity. Over time, gather these insights - what actions do you really enjoy? Which meetings are working effectively?

These insights are _private_ and need never leave your machine.

## Sharing
Faffage connects into other time-tracking services so you can choose what you want to share, with your employer or your clients (or your family, or your friends) - whatever system they're using.
